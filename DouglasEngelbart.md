**Interview**

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeSgaJt27PM 
- very bad interview but there seem to be very few
- DE's motivation seemed very similar to elon musk, he seems to be an idealist (positive)
- seeking for human augmenting through IT
- his work on human computer interfaces through radar systems is ground breaking, was strongly influenced  by vannevar bushs : as we may think

** Engelbart - Coevolution ** 

- hyothesis: after every technology advancement humanity (society?) needs time to gain experiences and ideas from information

- Dougles Engelbart created a System called NLS (Video mother of all demos)
- The goal of his work was to augment human collective, collaborating capabilities.
- He certainly had problems in integrating other people into his conceptual framework, it seemed difficult to integrate people from different domains. Solution finding a common conceptual framework, this is difficult even today as it approaches the problem from a human side of a thing, rather than just being pushed by technology.
- Today efforts sadly limit themselves to 'oh we are going  to automate things we do now'.The potential bootstrap process of augmenting people is overlooked.
- Scaling effects result in surprising phenomena.
- The very first thing when working in an environment is to integrate the ability to customize, extend the environment.
- Since the Macintosh we have been conditioned to use WIMP like environment.
- "Menues and things take so long to execute, and besides out vocabulary grew and grew"
- You need an environment which lets you dynamically shift abstraction to employ evolution. ( How can you flip your "own" interface on it?)
- D.E. argues because every one (or every vendor therefor) have its own environment there could be no evolution. "Evolution would be nailed down for financial advantage" <- This expresses worse is better, exactly.
- "So, I say no proprietary ownership of the class of functions you're going to employ"
- So this basically means, data and content would be private but the software operating on that data should be not propriety. So there could be software like photoshop but it should be possible to use its functionality outside, in composition with other functions or programs. Which is today only via intermediate file representations possible.
- Another meaning of this could be the Interface for a certain functionality should be open but its implementation could be propriety?
- The ability to address every content element in a document separately, emerged with REST technology.
- The tricycle analogy: they are easy to learn so should we stick (only) to them?
- [Vannevar Bush [1945]]
