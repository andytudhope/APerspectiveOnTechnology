- 2 important pooints to make progress:
- “use statistical data to see deficites, but you have to make the people use the vaccine”
- <= the same actually applies to DEs problem, his invention is a solution but people need to apply it, so you have to make sure they take the pill, otherwise the bootstrapping process cant start

## Inventing on principle 

- http://vimeo.com/36579366
- fight/work for your belief, example: against modes 

## Future of Programming

- http://vimeo.com/71278954
- pseudo retro
- what models for parallel/concurrent programming work?
- "Can computing be liberatred from Von neuman architecture"?
 
## Media for the unthinkable

- http://vimeo.com/67076984
- see notes "how to think an impossible thought"
  
## Drawing Dynamic Visualisations

- http://vimeo.com/66085662

- inspires to bring maker spaces und and his visilizations together to create a "real workshop"

## The Humane Representation of Thought

- http://vimeo.com/115154289
- Explains the motivation behind previous videos and for wha tyou could use seeing spaces "Augmenting human intellect"
- http://worrydream.com/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThought/note.html
- after discussing this with adrian he mentions the similarity with the "holo deck from star trek", But if this will come mainstream , usage patterns emerge, like  it took until deep space nine, when these became a bar/renting like thing
