## STEPS Project 

- bring history of STEPTS "re-inventing pesonal computing software" starting 2006, end 2014?
- this project represents a major shift in terms of "programming" paradigma and especially system design
- while (many-most) systems today are fundamentally based on low level general purpose programming languages (C)
- STEPS takes a different approach, because many parts of what it should do ( personal computing) are already present today in some form, it can focus on creating a similar, even better experience but reducing the complexity in software (LoC)
- the key difference oposing to the traditional approach is that the most outer domain spaces are modeled in very high Level DSL/POL almost Math computations, and these are then subsequently translated to a generic core (pattern language , e.g. Ometa)
- the resulting LoC Reduction is achieved because the DSLs can express Domain intent much more precise and sustinctly 
- this anable to build complex systems like a personal computing environment in < 20000 Loc
- my comment to final STEPS report regarding reproducible science https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11689492

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyIQKBzIuBY <- single video
- awards only for people rather than groups/teams
- Bob Barton - 5000
- No (Progress) => how to define progress?
- BB Teaching Method (grad school):
 - breaking to groud, (re) build from scratch
 - => we need to take a close look at this learning method, its fundamental, see principles: fundamental teaching
 - result: beeing free which means: coming to realize that computing is opinions and practice
- 1. Paradigm - Make & Fix , Object + Setter = Datastructure
- scale => can you define other Axis?
- -> Complexity <-> Complications (Methapher/Analogy for incidential Complexity?)
- 5 computing goals: creating,scaling, eternal computing, re-adaptions, comunicating with alines
- Internet TCP/IP 20k lines of code, Internet Design Principles, the web is a mess - why => dicuss
- 2.Paradigm - Grow & Negotiate
- 1. <--- Manipulation VS Meanings ---> 2.
- Biological Scale, how much "components" to get something useful
- Context for students:
 - Which is more important(General):
 
 
|  1 |  2 | 3 |
| -------- | -------- |-------- |
| IQ   | Knowledge   | Outlook   |
| Leonardo   | Ford   | Newton   |
| lead weight   | Silver   | Gold   |
 
  - Outlook => Point of View - worth 80 IQ points
 - Our Field => I think this slide describes problems of information overflow
 
 |IQ|Knowledge |Outlook|

- "Most people can only experience the present in terms of the past" <= quote by Mc Luan 
- "Which means they can only concieve the future in terms of the present" <= quote by Mc Luan 

- Cicero: to ignore the past is to be forever a child
- Human Learning & Memory
- paradigmatically challenged: what we learn first, we might learn too well
- problem with learning 1st progamming language:
 - tend to learn what computing is in persons mind
 - mitigate : learn 2-3 prog. lang.
- Past Present Future
-   ==  =====    ===
- "ignore present" but how is present defined here?
- The Arts - as in Technology
- tinkering, engeneering, mathematics, science <= where is software located?
- Stories for hundreads of thousands of years
- What is science? Charles Sanders Pierce - NAND NOR
- Computer Science: Mc Carthy <-> Dijkstra (he didnt understand LISP)
- Personal computing as a "Phenomena" -> Dozen Powerfull Principles => dicuss them
- Nile -> Compiler -> Compiler
- => find the point of view
- DSL vs. POL
- open your mind => discuss

Notes from 2013 blog: 

Good Work -> Research Community -> Broader Audience

destroy and rebuild -> "worst thing happening to a pogrammer" learning first language

Make & Fix  

functionality LOC complexity? 

good ratio . of scaling : TCP/IP

expand from M&F to grow and negoiate 

Scale needed to get a "living thing" bacteria example(concrete numbers?) relte to "objects"

IQ, Knowledge, Outlook

Why cant you leverage IQ on your own? need to bootsrap society, see engelbart

Computing turing into pop culture

  cicero 
we can ony imagine futre in incremental steps( human thinking linearly?)

What we learn first, we might learn too well ( frist PL language? solutions to this dilema? learn 3 languages at the same time?= 

The past is huge

past present future

imagine without present extrapolating form past to future

how long we are on earth? sience, since?

definition of computer sience

T shirt analogy

Lost words POL problem oriented lang<-> DSL
meaning forgotten?

- teaching, thinking
- Why where book pages invented?
- To make a reference onto previous said things.
- writing -> books -> computer
- each step enhanced capabilities in terms of self-reference (see hofstaedter)
- so question is what is the next step and how can we use the computer to do so

**SRI -  40th anniversary of Douglas Engelbart's 1968 "Mother of All Demos" - 10.09.2013**

- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSXXfiFQqPI
- The problem with augmentation methods device is that they could easily replace/limit our existing capaiites.
- worry dream makes same reference: are they refering to the same person: our abstrations enhance and limit our vision at the same time => this is a principle, find the name 
- it took 150 years for printing press to spread chang, how long will it take for the computer to spread chang?
- about 20:00 SPJ idea of fixing ICT
- if you argue pro something you set a foot note and its fine, if you dislike something you have to justify, longe that the whole argument point you are trying to make?

**Powerful Ideas Need Love Too! via Worrydream site - 1995**

- http://worrydream.com/refs/Kay%20-%20Powerful%20Ideas%20Need%20Love%20Too.html
- teaching as story telling ,bad? why in particular
- this kind of learning is ?common sense = “gesunder Menschenverstand”  
- isolated cases, stories to be trieved <-> not as a system of inter related arguments about what we think we know and how well we think we know it

**Thomas Paine Common Sense**

- https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine
- "Independence is my happiness, and I view things as they are, without regard to place or person; my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."

it will be very important for children to get fluent in thhe tree central forms of thinking that are now in use:
-stories
-logical arguments
-system dynamics

Hard to learn , but childrean learn anyway hard to learn things. They need reason ( and possibly a low range to sensomotoric experience) 
Difficulty is not the real issue here. Blonging to a culture and building a personal identity are.

This “create an embedded environment and support classrom teachers with visiting experts” ← SPJ fixing ICT ?
Making media on the internet that is self teaching the computer version of this will be able to find out how old and sophisticated is the sufer and instantly tailor a progression of learning experiences (**THATS what frickin wikipedia should be about**) that will have a much higher chance of introducing  each user to the “good stuff” that underlies most human knowledge.

**Notes on a conversation with alan kay - 20.04.2013**

- Some interesting points in this interview
- Peak Programming Languages
- Pattern regarding when in timeline programming langues appear which 'peak'
- 5-10 years? --> see alax payne blog post on emerging languages camp
- Programming Scala Education 
- Shakespeare -> TV
- CS -> boom of Personal Computing in 80s, expedience , dead line pressure
- Thoughts on User Interface
- "you never step in the same river twice" A user interface should be a learning environment, explore able in various ways. So it should adapt and change while using aiding in new contexts of the application.
- Also : Think of a programming language as a user interface.
- What was 'bad' about Smaltalk?
- Limited reflection
- C++ is a macro processor
- <= these reflections are technical only , social learning and conception principles are not regarded
- Microprocessor Architecture, Todays Microprocessor Architecture could be improved ( direction?)
- Language disposition
- There exist style languages
- APL, Lisp , Smalltalk
- agglutinative languages
- C++, Java..
- "Also, I think the style languages tend to be late-binding languages. The agglutinative languages are usually early-binding. That makes a huge difference in the whole approach. The kinds of bugs you have to deal with, and when you have to deal with them, is completely different."
- The has huge impacts on
- Late binding <-> Laziness
- W Cook states that there is a connection to algebras and co-algebras
- W. Cook on binding (=> found out via Gilad bracha that W cook has brain cancer :((( )
- Ideas, Good Ideas get discarded because they are not understood(B5000). Isolated processes
- Keep it simple, It is important to keep  a programming language in a state where children may use it without problems on their own. Zed Shaw seems to agree[2]

- really good quotes from AK:"... the user interface would have to become a learning environment along the lines of Montessori and Bruner; and [the] needs for large scope, reduction in complexity, and end-user literacy would require that data and control structures be done away with in favor of a more biological scheme of protected universal cells interacting only through messages that could mimic desired behavior.

... we were actually trying for a for a qualitative paradigm shift in belief structures -- a new Kuhnian paradigm in the same spirit as the invention of the printing press..."
- quote on pesonal computing: "I think one of the main consequences of the inventions of personal computing and the world wide Internet is that everyone gets to be a potential participant,
and this means that we now have the entire bell curve of humanity trying to be part of the action. This will dilute good design (almost stamp it out) until mass education can help most people get more savvy about what the new medium is all about. (This is not a fast process). What we have now is not dissimilar to the pop music scene vs the developed music culture (the former has almost driven out the latter -- and this is only possible where there is too little knowledge and taste to prevent it). Not a pretty sight."
